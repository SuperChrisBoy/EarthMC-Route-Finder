/**
 * Projection of when a nation's chunk bonus will drop a level as inactive residents are purged

 * The purge runs ~12:00 Europe/Berlin daily, so the drop is anchored to that moment; under a day out it's
 * expressed in hours (which, being an absolute instant, already reflects the viewer's offset from German time).
 *
 * @param nextBonus        the bonus level the nation drops to at {@link #dropDate()}
 * @param daysUntilDrop    whole calendar days (viewer-local) until the drop, or -1 if not predictable
 * @param hoursUntilDrop   whole hours until the drop; shown instead of days when under 24, or -1 if unknown
 * @param minutesUntilDrop whole minutes until the drop; shown instead of hours when under 60, or -1 if unknown
 * @param dropDate         human-readable date of the drop (e.g. "Jul 11 2026")
